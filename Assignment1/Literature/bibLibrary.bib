abstract = {Background: There has been rapid growth of mobile and wearable tools that may help to overcome challenges in the diagnosis and prediction of Major Depressive Disorder in children and adolescents, tasks that rely on clinical reporting that is inherently based on retrospective recall of symptoms and associated features. This article reviews more objective ways of measuring and monitoring mood within this population. Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed studies examined published research that employs mobile and wearable tools to characterize depression in children and/or adolescents. Our search strategy included the following terms: (1) monitoring or prediction (2) depression (3) mobile apps or wearables and (4) children and youth (including adolescents), and was applied to five databases. Results: Our search produced 829 citations (2008- Feb 2019), of which 30 (journal articles, conference papers and abstracts) were included in the analysis, and 2 reviews included in our discussion. The majority of the evidence involved smartphone apps, with very few studies using actigraphy. Mobile and wearables captured a variety of data including unobtrusive passive analytics, movement and light data, plus physical and mental health data, including depressive symptom monitoring. Most studies also examined feasibility. Limitations: This review was limited to published research in the English language. The review criteria excluded any apps that were mainly treatment focused, therefore there was not much of a focus on clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This scoping review yielded a variety of studies with heterogeneous populations, research methods and study objectives, which limited our ability to address our research objectives cohesively. Certain mobile technologies, however, have demonstrated feasibility for tracking depression that could inform models for predicting relapse.},

We analyzed three-year longitudinal data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey conducted by the National Youth Policy Institute in Korea. A total of 1877 valid responses from 2011 to 2013 were analyzed using autoregressive cross-lagged modeling. We found that each mobile phone addiction and depressive symptom in earlier years was associated with increasing severity in these conditions consistently over the three years. In addition, we found that the relationships between mobile phone addiction and depressive symptoms were bidirectional over the three years. The significant implications for these findings in the context of adolescent behavior are also discussed.},

abstract = {Depression is a serious mental illness. The symptoms associated with depression are both behavioral (in appetite, energy level, sleep) and cognitive (in interests, mood, concentration). Currently, survey instruments are commonly used to keep track of depression symptoms, which are burdensome and difficult to execute on a continuous basis. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of predicting all major categories of depressive symptoms automatically using smartphone data. Specifically, we consider two types of smartphone data, one collected passively on smartphones (through an app running on the phones) and the other collected from an institution's WiFi infrastructure (that does not require direct data capture on the phones), and construct a family of machine learning based models for the prediction. Both scenarios require no efforts from the users, and can provide objective assessment on depressive symptoms. Using smartphone data collected from 182 college students in a two-phase study, our results demonstrate that smartphone data can be used to predict both behavioral and cognitive symptoms effectively, with F1 score as high as 0.86. Our study makes a significant step forward over existing studies that only focus on predicting overall depression status (i.e., whether one is depressed or not).},

abstract = {Personal informatics systems for supporting health largely grew out of a “self”-centric orientation: self-tracking, self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-experimentation, self-improvement. Health management, however, even when self-driven, is inherently social and depends on a person's direct relationships and broader sociocultural contexts, as an emerging line of research is coming to recognize, study, and support. This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients' complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations. Based on these insights, we offer a model of this social ecology, along with design implications for personal informatics systems that are sensitive to these interpersonal contexts.},

Most existing systems require an interac- tion with the device, for example they may require the user to input his/her mood state at regular intervals. In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to un- obtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily question- naires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully pre- dict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyz- ing their movements},

Without observable diagnostic cri- teria, the signs of depression may go unnoticed, resulting in high demand for detecting depression in advance automati- cally. This paper tackles the challenging problem of forecast- ing severely depressed moods based on self-reported histo- ries. Despite the large amount of research on understanding individual moods including depression, anxiety, and stress based on behavioral logs collected by pervasive computing devices such as smartphones, forecasting depressed moods is still an open question. This paper develops a recurrent neu- ral network algorithm that incorporates categorical embed- ding layers for forecasting depression. We collected large- scale records from 2,382 self-declared depressed people to conduct the experiment. Experimental results show that our method forecast the severely depressed mood of a user based on self-reported histories, with higher accuracy than SVM. The results also showed that the long-term historical information of a user improves the accuracy of forecasting depressed mood.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown the potential of exploiting GPS data for passively inferring people's mental health conditions. However, feature extraction for characterizing human mobility remains a heuristic process that relies on the domain knowledge of the condition under consideration. Moreover, we do not have guarantees that these "hand-crafted" metrics are able to effectively capture mobility behavior of users. Indeed, informative emerging patterns in the data might not be characterized by them. This is also a complex and often time-consuming task, since it usually consists of a lengthy trial-and-error process.In this paper, we investigate the potential of using autoencoders for automatically extracting features from the raw input data. Through a series of experiments we show the effectiveness of autoencoder-based features for predicting depressive states of individuals compared to "hand-crafted" ones. Our results show that automatically extracted features lead to an improvement of the performance of the prediction models, while, at the same time, reducing the complexity of the feature design task. Moreover, through an extensive experimental performance analysis, we demonstrate the optimal configuration of the key parameters at the basis of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {There are rising rates of depression on college campuses. Mental health services on our campuses are working at full stretch. In response researchers have proposed using mobile sensing for continuous mental health assessment. Existing work on understanding the relationship between mobile sensing and depression, however, focuses on generic behavioral features that do not map to major depressive disorder symptoms defined in the standard mental disorders diagnostic manual (DSM-5). We propose a new approach to predicting depression using passive sensing data from students' smartphones and wearables. We propose a set of symptom features that proxy the DSM-5 defined depression symptoms specifically designed for college students. We present results from a study of 83 undergraduate students at Dartmouth College across two 9-week terms during the winter and spring terms in 2016. We identify a number of important new associations between symptom features and student self reported PHQ-8 and PHQ-4 depression scores. The study captures depression dynamics of the students at the beginning and end of term using a pre-post PHQ-8 and week by week changes using a weekly administered PHQ-4. Importantly, we show that symptom features derived from phone and wearable sensors can predict whether or not a student is depressed on a week by week basis with 81.5% recall and 69.1% precision.},

abstract = {Depression is the major cause of years lived in disability world-wide; however, its diagnosis and tracking methods still rely mainly on assessing self-reported depressive symptoms, methods that originated more than fifty years ago. These methods, which usually involve filling out surveys or engaging in face-to-face interviews, provide limited accuracy and reliability and are costly to track and scale. In this paper, we develop and test the efficacy of machine learning techniques applied to objective data captured passively and continuously from E4 wearable wristbands and from sensors in an Android phone for predicting the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Input data include electrodermal activity (EDA), sleep behavior, motion, phone-based communication, location changes, and phone usage patterns. We introduce our feature generation and transformation process, imputing missing clinical scores from self-reported measures, and predicting depression severity from continuous sensor measurements. While HDRS ranges between 0 and 52, we were able to impute it with 2.8 RMSE and predict it with 4.5 RMSE which are low relative errors. Analyzing the features and their relation to depressive symptoms, we found that poor mental health was accompanied by more irregular sleep, less motion, fewer incoming messages, less variability in location patterns, and higher asymmetry of EDA between the right and the left wrists.},

abstract = {Objective: Depression is currently the second most significant contributor to non-fatal disease burdens globally. While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients' mobile usage patterns. Materials and Methods: 412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score ≥ 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified. Results: Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants' age and gender were included. Discussions/Conclusion: The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments. Moreover, the input variables used in this study were aggregated mobile usage metadata attributes, which has low privacy sensitivity making it more likely for patients to grant required application permissions.},

abstract = {Background: Depression carries significant financial, medical, and emotional burden on modern society. Various proof-of-concept studies have highlighted how apps can link dynamic mental health status changes to fluctuations in smartphone usage in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the use of such apps to monitor adolescents remains a challenge. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether smartphone apps are useful in evaluating and monitoring depression symptoms in a clinically depressed adolescent population compared with the following gold-standard clinical psychometric instruments: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Methods: We recruited 13 families with adolescent patients diagnosed with MDD with or without comorbid anxiety disorder. Over an 8-week period, daily self-reported moods and smartphone sensor data were collected by using the Smartphone- and OnLine usage-based eValuation for Depression (SOLVD) app. The evaluations from teens' parents were also collected. Baseline depression and anxiety symptoms were measured biweekly using PHQ-9, HAM-D, and HAM-A. Results: We observed a significant correlation between the self-evaluated mood averaged over a 2-week period and the biweekly psychometric scores from PHQ-9, HAM-D, and HAM-A (0.45≤|r|≤0.63; P=.009, P=.01, and P=.003, respectively). The daily steps taken, SMS frequency, and average call duration were also highly correlated with clinical scores (0.44≤|r|≤0.72; all P<.05). By combining self-evaluations and smartphone sensor data of the teens, we could predict the PHQ-9 score with an accuracy of 88% (23.77/27). When adding the evaluations from the teens' parents, the prediction accuracy was further increased to 90% (24.35/27). Conclusions: Smartphone apps such as SOLVD represent a useful way to monitor depressive symptoms in clinically depressed adolescents, and these apps correlate well with current gold-standard psychometric instruments. This is a first study of its kind that was conducted on the adolescent population, and it included inputs from both teens and their parents as observers. The results are preliminary because of the small sample size, and we plan to expand the study to a larger population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate reporting of patient symptoms is critical for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in psychiatry. Smartphones offer an accessible, low-cost means to collect patient symptoms in real time and aid in care.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate adherence among psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder in utilizing their personal smartphones to run a custom app to monitor Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression symptoms, as well as to examine the correlation of these scores to traditionally administered (paper-and-pencil) PHQ-9 scores.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 13 patients with major depressive disorder, referred by their clinicians, received standard outpatient treatment and, in addition, utilized their personal smartphones to run the study app to monitor their symptoms. Subjects downloaded and used the Mindful Moods app on their personal smartphone to complete up to three survey sessions per day, during which a randomized subset of PHQ-9 symptoms of major depressive disorder were assessed on a Likert scale. The study lasted 29 or 30 days without additional follow-up. Outcome measures included adherence, measured by the percentage of completed survey sessions, and estimates of daily PHQ-9 scores collected from the smartphone app, as well as from the traditionally administered PHQ-9.\n\nRESULTS: Overall adherence was 77.78% (903/1161) and varied with time of day. PHQ-9 estimates collected from the app strongly correlated (r=.84) with traditionally administered PHQ-9 scores, but app-collected scores were 3.02 (SD 2.25) points higher on average. More subjects reported suicidal ideation using the app than they did on the traditionally administered PHQ-9.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with major depressive disorder are able to utilize an app on their personal smartphones to self-assess their symptoms of major depressive disorder with high levels of adherence. These app-collected results correlate with the traditionally administered PHQ-9. Scores recorded from the app may potentially be more sensitive and better able to capture suicidality than the traditional PHQ-9.},
